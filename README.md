# Cloudera Altus Director API clients

[Cloudera Altus Director](https://www.cloudera.com/products/product-components/cloudera-director.html) is the reliable, self-service experience for Clouderaâ€™s enterprise data hub in the cloud - allowing enterprises to unlock all the benefits of Hadoop in the cloud, without compromising on the critical aspects of an enterprise-grade, Hadoop platform.

## About

This repository contains the source code of the Cloudera Altus Director [Java](java-client/) and [Python](python-client/) API clients that can be used to interact with the Cloudera Altus Director server API to bootstrap, grow, shrink and terminate CDH clusters managed by Cloudera Manager on a cloud infrastructure. It is not required to use either client library to interact with the server API; they are offered for convenience.

API clients are generated from the server API itself. Therefore, pull requests are not accepted for them.
